**Contents**
* **(project 1) Police presence in Nigeria**: This aims to study the presence of police in various zones and states in nigeria, and their adequacy for the population, the data was gathered from the crime statistics report of the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, the data was seperated from the the general work sheet with minimal cleaning in excel to better perform as a csv file in the python environment, The officer per zone population data was gathered from the the website of the Nigerian police force and compiled into csv format with the addition of columns that were suited to the data.
